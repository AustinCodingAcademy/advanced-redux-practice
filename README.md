### Reducers
+ Create a new folder called reducers
+ Create a file in this folder called index.js
+ Import combineReducers from redux
+ Create a reducer function for each piece of data in state.js, newComments, tasks…. etc
+ Remember 2 parameters state and action. Remember to return state
+ Combine the reducers and export

### Create Database
+ Create a store.js file
+ Import createStore from redux
+ Import state from state.js
+ Import reducers from reducers/index
+ Create the store and export it

### Provide store to components
+ In index.js
+ Import Provider from react-redux
+ Import store from store.js
+ Use Provider component to wrap App
+ Give Provider a prop “store” and the value of the store

### Create Containers
+ In each component that should care about data:
+ Import connect from react-redux
+ Create a function called mapStateToProps that takes parameter state
+ Return an object. Decide what prop the component needs and this will be a key on the object
+ Decide what data from state the component needs and that will be the value on the object
+ Use the connect function and mapStateToProps to turn the component into a container
+ Export the container

### Containers
+ Tickets (use as example)
+ TransactionPanel 
+ TopNav
+ TasksPanel
+ Comments
+ Orders
+ Tasks


### Fix
+ In App.js remove the props parameter and all instances of passing props 
+ In index.js remove all instances of state and passing props to App
